# Project 1: Comparison Analysis of LSTM and GRU in Predicting Indonesia’s Strategic Commodities Price
* Compared two Recurrent Neural Network models, LSTM and GRU, in predicting daily price of Indonesia’s strategic commodities
* The data was consisted of 2192 daily price (2016-2021) of 10 commodities
* Found the best model with the least amount of error (using MAE and MAPE) and compared them again with the convenient model already used by the government that is ARIMA, and presented the result of prediction done all models through graphics
* All done using Phyton (Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas) in Google Colaboratory
