# [Project 1: Comparison Analysis of LSTM and GRU in Predicting Indonesia’s Strategic Commodities Price](https://github.com/zhuppyra/price_forecasting)
* Thesis project
* Timeline: January-August 2022
* Compared two Recurrent Neural Network models, LSTM and GRU, in predicting daily price of Indonesia’s strategic commodities
* The data was consisted of 2192 daily price (2016-2021) of 10 commodities
* Found the best model with the least amount of error (using MAE and MAPE) and compared them again with the convenient model already used by the government that is ARIMA, and presented the result of prediction done all models through graphics
* All done using Phyton (Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas) in Google Colaboratory


# [Project 2: Employee Turnover Prediction Using KNN & ANN](https://github.com/zhuppyra/K-Nearest-Neighbor)
* Academic project
* Developed a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification model in predicting employee turnover rate (open source data)
* The data consisted of 14999 rows and 10 columns about employees, which was obtained from online open source platform
* Model building was done using WEKA, RapidMiner Studio, and SPSS

# [Project 3: Employee Turnover Analysis using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/zhuppyra/Logistic-Regression)
* Academic project
* Using the same data as Project 2, this time Logistic Regression is utilized to explore the relationship between a categorical response variable (employee leaving or retained) and a set of predictor variables
* The model was built in R Studio

# Project 4: Marketing Strategy Analysis Using Association Roles in Convenience Store
* Academic project
* Implementation of association rules to determine customers’ buying patterns
* The result was used to formulate marketing strategy to increase sales in convenience store
* The data consisted of around a hundred transaction data collected from different customers
* Data processing was done using Orange3

# Project 5: Marketing Strategy Analysis Using Analytical Hierarchy Process in Kusuma Jaya Batik
* Academic project
* Employment of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as one of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques in deciding which marketing strategy suit Kusumajaya Batik the best to increase sales
* Data processing was done in two manners, manual calculation in Microsoft Excel and using open source software called Super Decision

# Project 6: Utilization of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in Reducing the Dimensions of Customer Interaction with Clothing and Cosmetic Sellers on Facebook
* Academic project
* Utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in reduction of reactions that viewers gave to online sellers during live shopping on facebook
* The data was obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, consisted of 7050 rows of 12 different reactions
* Data processing was done using SPSS.
